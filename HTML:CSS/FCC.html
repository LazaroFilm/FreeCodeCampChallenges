    <p>Operating Steadicam is like using a sniper rifle while running after your target</p>
    <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of Steadicam. First of all, a good Steadcicam operator has to be a great camera operator. Steadicam should only be a tool to achieve the desired shot, not the other way around. </p>

    <p>This is where you will learn the different components that make a Steadicam rig.</p>
    <p>The main parts of the rig are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the vest</li>
      <li>the arm</li>
      <li>the sled</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All three are composed of smaller parts.</p>
    <code>yeah!</code>

  <section id="Balancing_the_rig" class="main-section">
    <header>Balancing the rig</header>
    <p>You need to balance the camera perfectly in order to take full advantage of the system. A good balance is critical to a good operating.</p>
    <p>Before even attempting to balance your rig you need to make sure that you have all the parts you will be flying on the sled, including all the accessories, all cables, batteries and memory cards. It is possible to add or remove items after,
      but you will need to trim the balance to compensate for the weight shift.</p>
    <code>Yeah!</code>
  </section>
  <section id="Posture_while_operating" class="main-section">
    <header>Posture while operating</header>
    <p>Keeping a bad posture while operating can lead to serious injuries, it is critical that you learn the proper form.</p>
    <code>Woohoo!</code>

  <section id="Don_Juan,_Missionary,_High_mode,_Low_Mode" class="main-section">
    <header>Don Juan, Missionary, High mode, Low Mode</header>
    <p>There are may way you can use your Steadicam to get the shot, it's important to train in every configuration possible.</p>
    <p>With a Steadicam, the camera is flying freely next to your body, that allows you to move it around and turn it into positions that would not be possible on the shoulder. There are multiple positions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Missionary, with the camera facing forward</li>
      <li>Don Juan, with the camera facing behind you</li>
      <li>High mode, where the camera is on top of the sled</li>
      <li>Low mode, where the camera is at the bottom.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can switch between missionary and don juan without modifying your sled balance, however, you will need to adjust your sled between high and low modes.</p>
    <code>ohh Yeah</code>

  <section id="The_future" class="main-section">
    <header>The future</header>
    <p>This is the doom and gloom section where you get desilutioned and face the truth. </p>
    <p>Let me make this clear and simple, why do you thing I'm spending my days learning code? Steadicam is amazing, but given the current situation in the world with COVID19, Steadicam opearting will be much harder to achieve safely.</p>
    <code>Booh!</code>
